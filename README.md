As of May 2019, videos were being uploaded at a rate of more than 500 hours of content per minute.

# About Dataset:
The dataset 'Youtube Trending Dataset' contains 7 columns, each are:
**(1)Rank:** rank of youtuber (sorted by subscribers)

**(2)Youtuber:** Name of youtuber

**(3)Subscribers:** Number of subscribers

**(4)Video Views:** Total views of video

**(5)Video Count:** Number of uploaded videos

**(6)Category:** Category of video

**(7)Started:** Started year

# Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Gathered a diverse dataset of YouTube trending channels, including video metadata, view counts, subscribers, category, and other relevant metrics.
Conducted data cleaning to address missing values and inconsistencies, ensuring data accuracy and quality.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Matplotlib and Seaborn:
Utilized Matplotlib, Seaborn and PlotLy libraries in Python to perform comprehensive EDA.
Created insightful visualizations to understand the distribution of view counts, video count, subscribers, and other engagement metrics.
Analyzed trends in video categories, video views, and publishing times to identify factors influencing video popularity.

# Statistical Analysis:
Conducted statistical analysis to identify correlations between engagement metrics and potential influencers of video performance.

# Insights:
**(1) Start year of Top100 youtube channels are mainly distributed in 2006 and early 2010s.**

**(2) Music, entertainment and People & Blogs ranked top 3 higest percentage of category proportion.**

**(3) As shown below, we can see that Sports, Shows and Film & Animation categories ranked top 3 mean of subscribers.**

**(4) One can found that category of 'People and Blogs' & Entertainment has high video counts, while low video views relatively.**

**(5) Distribution of each categories on video views and video counts is shown below.**

**(6) It can be easily seen that music, education, Film & Animation are top3 categories that have most subscribers. Includes: T-Series, YouTube Movies and Cocomelon - Nuresery Rhymes.**

**(7) Subscribers per year:
    With the exception of 2018 year, subscribers per year was higher before 2010.
    We can guess that this is due to the accumulation of time.
    While 2018 has the highest number of subscribers, this is due to the fact that there's only sole data of 2018.**
    
**(8) Correlation: We can notice that there's high correlation 0.82 with subscribers and video views.**

# Impact Assessment:
Evaluated the impact of recommended content strategies on video performance metrics, such as total views and counts, over a specific timeframe.
By applying data visualization techniques with Matplotlib, Seaborn and PlotLy, and implementing feature engineering, I gained a comprehensive understanding of YouTube trending channels. The project equipped me with advanced data analysis skills, proficiency in Python visualization libraries, and the ability to uncover actionable insights to drive content marketing success.
